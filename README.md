# IOT based doorlock system with automatic hand and handle sanitization
Keeping homes safe has to turn into one of the topics of the major issue. home security is much required. Home security requires a protected door lock system. The purpose of this work is to resolve one of the security problems existing in these worlds. It has been very tough for people to ensure effective security and a handle sanitization that will sanitize the door handle automatically by sensing the hand.

The second part of project model(Fig.2) contains two sections – Where first is ultrasonic sensor and 2nd is servo motor.Here the ultrasonic sensor is connected to the nodemcu and also the servo motor is connected to the nodemcu. Nodemcu controls and gives supply to servo motor and ultrasonic sensor.
